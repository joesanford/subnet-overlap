# subnet-overlap

> A Vue.js app for finding overlaps in IP subnet ranges

After my first time deploying Kubernetes into a pre-existing VPC, and hitting subnet collisions, I decided to build a tool to figure out what subnets had overlaps.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
